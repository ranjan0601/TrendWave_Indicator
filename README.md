# TrendWave_Indicator
This is a trend-following indicator that dynamically adapts to market trends using upper and lower bands. It visually highlights trend strength and duration through color intensity while providing additional wave bands for deeper trend analysis.

### Key Feature
### Adaptive Trend Bands: 

- Displays a lower band in uptrends and an upper band in downtrends to indicate trend direction.
- The bands act as dynamic support and resistance levels, helping traders identify potential entry and exit points.

### Wave Bands for Additional Analysis:
- A dashed wave band appears opposite the main trend band for deeper trend confirmation.
- In an uptrend, the upper dashed wave band helps analyze momentum, while in a downtrend, the lower dashed wave band serves the same purpose.
### Gradient Color Intensity:
- The trend bands have a color gradient that fades as the trend continues, helping traders visualize trend duration.
- The wave bands have an inverse gradient effect—starting with low intensity at the trend's beginning and increasing in intensity as the trend progresses.
### Trend Change Signals:
- Circular markers appear at trend reversals, providing clear entry and exit points.
- These signals mark transitions between bullish and bearish phases based on price action.
### Stock Scanner:
- Scan the list of stocks to find the best to buy.
- Provide absolute buying or selling opportunity by scanning portfolio.

## Usages

- Volatility Awareness: Volatility-based bands help traders adjust their strategies based on market volatility, ensuring better risk management.
